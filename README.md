# Preemptive Sleep Detection to avoid road accidents

An OpenCV project which analyses a person's face to look for indications such as drowsy eyes to preemptively detect if a person is about to fall asleep and sound an alarm to potentially prevent drivers from falling asleep while on the wheel.

## Usage

Run
`python detect_drowsiness.py --shape-predictor shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat --alarm alarm.wav`
